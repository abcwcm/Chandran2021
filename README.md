# SIFT-seq: VDJ and scRNA-seq of T cells targeting public neoantigens

GEO accession number: GSE172403

Na√Øve CD8+ T cells from healthy donor samples were stimulated in vitro with mutated PIK3CA. Following a qPCR screen to identify mutation-specific upregulation of inflammatory transcript, positive wells were selcted for SIFT-seq. Matched aliquots were restimulated acutely with antigen-presenting wells expressing WT or mutated PIK3CA and subject to single-cell RNA-seq and V(D)J immunoprofiling using the 10x genomics platform. All clonotypes associated with a mutation-specific activation signature were identified and their TCR gene sequences were retrieved. Candidate TCR gene sequences were retrovirally transferred to open-repertoire T cell to confirm mutation-specific recognition.
